# Intro
This repo is based off https://github.com/krzysztofzuraw/parcel-emotion-typescript.git 
which is a barebones parcel / emotion /typescript stack.

I added some request animation frame code.

An animated circle grows while panes animate in.
These are triggered by mouse up down.

Works in chrome and IE11.
